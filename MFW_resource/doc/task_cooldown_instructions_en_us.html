    <h1>Task Cooldown Instructions</h1>

    <h2>1. Function Introduction</h2>
    <p>This tool is designed to prevent automated tasks from running repeatedly and wasting time. You can set the running interval for tasks. When the refresh time has not been reached, the system will automatically skip the task. The tool supports three modes: daily, weekly, and monthly, and also allows you to set the number of cycles and the minimum interval within each period.</p>

    <h2>2. Interface Overview</h2>
    <p>After opening the task management interface, find the "Task Cooldown" related settings area. This area contains the following main sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mode Selection</strong>: Radio buttons for daily, weekly, and monthly modes.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Settings</strong>: Different time setting options are provided based on the selected mode.</li>
        <li><strong>Cycle Settings</strong>: Set the maximum number of times the task can run within each period and the minimum interval.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Detailed Setup Steps</h2>
    
    <h3>(1) Daily Mode Setup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Select Mode</strong>: Click the "Daily Mode" radio button.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Refresh Time</strong>: In the time selection area, find the input boxes for setting hours and minutes, and enter the specific refresh time. For example, if you want to set the refresh time to 8:00 every day, enter 8 in the input box.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Cycle Count and Minimum Interval</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cycle Count</strong>: Enter the maximum number of times the task can run within each period in the "Cycle Count" input box. For example, setting it to 3 means the task can run a maximum of 3 times per day.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum Interval</strong>: Enter the minimum interval time (the unit may be minutes according to the interface prompt) between each task run in the "Minimum Interval" input box. For example, setting it to 60 means the task must have an interval of at least 60 minutes between each run.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>(2) Weekly Mode Setup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Select Mode</strong>: Click the "Weekly Mode" radio button.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Refresh Date</strong>: In the weekday selection area, select the day of the week when the task will refresh. For example, select "Wednesday".</li>
        <li><strong>Set Refresh Time</strong>: Follow the same method as in the daily mode to set the refresh time, and enter the specific hours and minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Cycle Count and Minimum Interval</strong>: The setup method is the same as in the daily mode.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>(3) Monthly Mode Setup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Select Mode</strong>: Click the "Monthly Mode" radio button.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Refresh Date</strong>: Enter the specific date of the month when the task will refresh in the date input box, with a range of 1 - 31. For example, entering 15 means the task will refresh on the 15th of each month.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Refresh Time</strong>: Enter the specific hours and minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Cycle Count and Minimum Interval</strong>: The setup method is the same as in the daily mode.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Confirm Settings</h2>
    <p>After completing all the above settings, click the "Confirm" button to save the settings. The system will execute tasks according to the mode, refresh time, cycle count, and minimum interval you have set.</p>

    <h2>5. Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time Format</strong>: Ensure that the entered time format is correct, with hours ranging from 0 - 23 and minutes ranging from 0 - 59.</li>
        <li><strong>Date Range</strong>: In the monthly mode, the entered date should be between 1 - 31. The system will automatically handle date differences for different months.</li>
        <li><strong>Cycle Count</strong>: When the cycle count is set to 0, the task will not run within that period.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Interval</strong>: Set the minimum interval reasonably to avoid setting it too short, which may cause the task to run too frequently, or too long, which may prevent the task from running the expected number of times.</li>
    </ul>
